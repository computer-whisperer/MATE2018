Hardware documentation for: MATE Motor Control PCB, REV 1

Component identification: 

    6 Motor drives (Pololu 24V12)
        Numbered (and addressed) 1-6, starting in the upper left corner and counting clockwise.
        Drives 1-3 are connected to +24V_A, and drives 4-6 are connected to +24V_B. The drives can
        be reprogrammed by lifting the end connected to the 0.1in header to access the USB port.
        Motor speed limit should be set to 2400 and baud rate to 9600 for all drives, addresses 
        count as described earlier. 

        Bank 1 RESET: PC3 / A3
        Bank 2 RESET: PC2 / A2
        All Banks TX: PC4 / A4
   
    8 Low-Side Switches:
        These switches are broken out to odd numbered pins on the wire terminals. They can sink up to
        3A each if the supply rail has suffficent capacity. Even numbered pins can be configured to
        supply +24V or +48V. Short-circuit protection may not work at 48V.

        DIO0-DIO3 - +24V_A
        DIO 0: PD6 / D6
        DIO 1: PD5 / D5
        DIO 2: PD4 / D4
        DIO 3: PD3 / D3
        DIO0-DIO4 - +24V_B
        DIO 4: PB2 / D10
        DIO 5: PB1 / D9
        DIO 6: PB0 / D8
        DIO 7: PD7 / D7

    1 RS485 Tranciever
        This tranciever recieves data from the control board to command the motor drives and low-side switches.
        PLEASE NOTE PULLUPS MUST BE ENABLED ON THE UART RX PINS IF THE DIR PIN IS EVER GOING TO BE HIGH!

        TX/RX: UART0
        DIR  : PD2 / D2 (LOW is RX mode, HIGH is TX mode)

    2 RS485 Periphrial Ports:
        These are simply breakouts for RS485 buses 1-2 from the control PCB. They hav no connection the the MC
        board microcontroller. A 4-pin Harwin Datamate L-tek is used as the connector. +5v is rated for 0.5A total across both buses,
        GND is rated for 3A per bus. Pinouts are as follows:
        
        +5v   : 1
        485_A : 2
        485_B : 3
        GND   : 4

    1 ATMEGA328P
        Midrange AVR microcontroller, the same as used on the Arduino UNO. Clock is a 16MHz crystal. Vcc is 5v.

    1 6-Pin AVR ISP Port
        A standard AVR 6-Pin AVR programming port. Vtg is left floating. This port is the only way to program the board.
